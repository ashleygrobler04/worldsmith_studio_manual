# Chapter 3: Opening A Project

When a project has been created, the main menu of Worldsmith Studio will change to show a list of recently-opened projects.

It is worth noting that this list will only include files which still exist. If you move or rename a file before this list loads, it will not show up.

You can click any of these files to open them, or choose a file from somewhere else by clicking the "Open Project" button or pressing Control + O.
