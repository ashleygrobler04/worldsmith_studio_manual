## Getting Started

To get started, begin by learning about [core concepts](welcome/concepts.md).

If you want to get straight down to business, you can read about [creating](projects/creating_a_project.md) and [opening](projects/opening_a_project.md) projects.

If you already have a project created that you want to build, see the section on [building](appendices/building_projects.md).
