# Creating A Project

When you run Worldsmith Studio for the first time, you will see a screen with buttons for creating and opening projects.

To create a project, you can click the "Create Project" button, or use the keyboard shortcut Control + N. You will see an appropriate dialogue for creating a file on your operating system.

It is recommended that you stick with the default filename `project.json`, but this is not enforced. Also, you can safely rename your project file any time it is *not* open in Worldsmith Studio.

When you have selected a directory, and given your project a filename, you will be taken to the project settings for your new project.

If you want to close your project and return to the main menu, you can click the back button, or press Control + W.
