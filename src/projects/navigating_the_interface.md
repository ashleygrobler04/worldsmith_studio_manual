# Navigating The Interface

Worldsmith Studio has a lot of different screens. Every attempt has been made to ensure easy and consistent navigation across the different parts of the interface.

If you find this not to be the case, please submit an issue.

## Tabbed Screens

Many screens - most notably the main project screen - use tabs to provide an overview and context. You can navigate through these types of screens in several ways:

### Mouse Or Keyboard

You can click on the tabs at the bottom of the screen to move to a different tab.

If you are using a keyboard, the left and right arrow keys also work to focus the different tabs, and the enter or space bar keys will select.

### Control + Tab

You can use the key combination Control + Tab to navigate to the next tab, or Control + Shift + Tab to navigate to the previous one.

This key combination will wrap around to the first tab when used in the last tab, and Control + Shift + Tab does the opposite.

### Control + Numbers

You can use the Control key in combination with the number row to move to the different tabs.

For example, if you had three tabs, "First", "Seconds", and "Third", Control + 1 would move you to the "First" tab, Control + 2 to the "Second", and Control + 3 to the "Third".

This works all the way up to Control + 9 for the ninth tab, and Control + 0 for the tenth.

## Numerical Controls

When a number is displayed, such as when setting the frames per second for your world, you can use the equals (=) key to increase the number, and the dash (-) to decrease.

How much these keys affect the value is dependant on the number being shown. For example, with frames per second, equals doubles the number, while dash halves it.

## Coordinates

If a set of coordinates is displayed, quite often you can use alt and the arrow keys to adjust the value.

- Alt + Up Arrow: Increase the y axis (move north).
- Alt + Right Arrow: Increase the x axis (move east).
- Alt + Down Arrow: Decrease the y axis (move south).
- Alt + Left Arrow: Decrease the x axis (move west).

## Zone Movement

When editing [zones](../projects/zones.md), you can move through the zone when you are focussed on the coordinates in the Canvas tab (Control + 2) by pressing control and the arrow keys.

- Control + Up Arrow: Move north.
- Control + Right Arrow: Move east.
- Control + Down Arrow: Move south.
- Control + Left Arrow: Move West.
